An Online Book Exchange System with Automatic Suggestions is a web application which is for students, book lovers and all who need books. Users can exchange their extra/unnecessary books with other users and users can also buy books. And the exciting fact is, it can automatically suggest the best possible matching to the users and users can request for exchange book from the suggestions. So users do not need to manually search for all exchange posts because users are getting the best possible matchings with other users. The automatic suggestion system works based on various condition matching technique like same book and author names, same category books but different author, same author but different books, same city based on users location etc. In future more features can be added in this project like userâ€™s book selling system, book donating, share their exchange post to their social media, Artificial Intelligence can use to prevent any kind of mischief etc.
